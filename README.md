This repo contains visual demos of several algorithms. The aim is to help users grasp the problem/algorithm but visualizing the output. This repo is a work in progress and it will grow to contain other algorithms.

The following is a list of algorithms for which visualizations exist:

* Largest White Square in Grid

The problem asks to find the largest (in terms of area) white square in a grid where cells can be either white or black. Here is an exapmle where the optimal squares are highlighted in light blue.
